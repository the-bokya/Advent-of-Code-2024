# TODO
  - [x] Write a proper algo to connect obstacles from one end to the other.
  - [x] Previous p2 was bruteforce. The new one looks for an unbroken connection from one edge to the other for each addition

# Update

I made a binary search version combining my edge connection approach. Now the final solution is around 150x faster than the original.
